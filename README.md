# Inspiration for Hanuman Jump
For this version of Hanuman Jump, we are taking the Hindu story and giving it a 21st Centry, Call of Duty/Battlefront/Halo-like twist to an iconic story of the Ramayan. Imagine you, the pilot of the Royal Sun Air Force with General Ram at the helm.  One of the allies, Commander Jambuvan has given you the most technical and tactical training, and has given you the permission to fly this reconnaisance mission.  You must pilot the JRx3 fighter aircraft, which has some unique capabilities.
